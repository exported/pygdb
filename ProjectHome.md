This is a simple python wrapper around GDB.  Currently the focus of this module is to provide the following:

  * Attach to existing processes
  * Create a new process from an executable
  * Callback/event or other mechanism for detecting the debugger has caught an exception/breakpoint/AV
  * Ability to get a stack trace, dump registers and create a dump file (core)
  * Works on last two versions of OS X
  * Works on Linux
  * Module works when run in a worker thread in Python
